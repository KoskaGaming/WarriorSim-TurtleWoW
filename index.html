<!-- 
TO ADD:
item level and quality to each piece in the gear list
correct set bonus and upperkara gear ID's when database up
T2 DPS 3p - 15% haste for 5 sec after overpower
T2 DPS 8p - WW hits 2 extra targets
T3 DPS 8p bonus - increase dmg of next melee attack by 30 after crit
T3 DPS 8p bonus as "other" buff as its party wide
T3.5 5p bonus when details released 
slam rework
sweeping strikes (upstream needs too)

TO FIX:
non gcd items delaying cast until open gcd (bloodrage/bloodfury/slayers)
MRP not using 
Berserker stance 3% crit aura not showing, maybe working on back end? (upstream needs too)
Bonechopper proc'ing more than 30ppm, maybe small .01s cd? 
Weapon with procs cause sunder/hms/pummel to trigger WF and double procs very often


TO EXPLORE:
Haste may be overvalued in some cases
Hit may be overvalued in some cases
Default min reaction time used a lot when 200ms is a long time between chained non gcd spells
Rage formula needs refining. Decent for lvl 60's, but doesnt give enough rage as you get lower level
